## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Hugo**: You can download and install Hugo from [Hugo's official website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

- **Node.js and npm**: Svelte requires Node.js and npm. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the Fireshop repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SinoLewis/fireshop.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fireshop
   ```

3. You own git dev branch (optional)

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your_dev_branch_name
    ```

4. Install the required Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Hugo Configuration**: Update the `config.toml` file in the root directory to configure your Hugo site settings, such as site title, description, and more.

2. **Svelte Configuration**: Modify Svelte components in the `src/components` directory to customize the user interface and functionality.

## Usage


- `npm start`: Main dev server. Runs everything you need.
- `npm run svelte`: Runs components in isolation. Serves `app/index.html` as a playground for components.
- `npm run hugo:serve`: Only runs static site.
- `npm run build`: Hugo & Svelte Build for production

This command will build and serve the Hugo site along with the Svelte components. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6969` to see your Fireshop in action!

## Customization

### Developing Components

Create a Svelte file in the `app/components` directory. It must have a custom element tag.

```html
<svelte:options tag="cart-info" />

<script>
  export let info: string;
</script>

<h1>Good cookup sesh! {info}</h1>
```

Export the component from `app/main.ts` as per [svelte docs](https://webcomponents.dev/docs/svelte):

```ts
export * from "./components/hi-mom.svelte";
```

Now use it in anywhere in your HTML or Markdown.

```html
<hi-mom greeting="i made a web component"></hi-mom>
```

**Note 1:** Web components styles are encapsulated through the [Shadow DOM](https://web.dev/shadowdom-v1/). Global styles will not work as part of Shadow DOM concept of styling.
**Note 2:** You can use Tailwind, with `@apply` in the component or the css used by [tailwindcss docs](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs).

### Theming

- You can customize the theme of your Fireshop by editing Hugo templates located in the `layouts` directory. 
- Styles can be found in the `styles` directory
- Components for the Svelte portion of the app can be found in the `src/components` directory.

### Product Catalog

Manage your product catalog by creating and editing content files in the `content/products` directory. You can utilize Hugo's content management system to easily add, remove, or update products.

### API Integration

To fetch real-time product information, integrate with external APIs by modifying Svelte components in the `src/components` directory. Use libraries like `fetch` or `axios` to make API requests.
