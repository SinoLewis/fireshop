      <description>The following lesson uses the Cloud Vision API on Google Cloud to extract text from raw images. This is a highly sought-after feature in business applications that still work with non-digitized text documents.
The Cloud Vision Node.js documentation is a good reference to keep by your side.
Getting Started You actually don&amp;rsquo;t need a frontend app to experiment with this technology - just a Firebase storage bucket. I recommend creating a dedicated bucket for the invocation of cloud functions.</description>

      <description>One of the most commonly encountered limitations of Cloud Firestore (and GCP) is full-text search. This functionality is essential if you need to query complex text patterns in a database or filter results by multiple dynamic properties. My favorite solution to this limitation is Algolia, which provides a powerful, developer-friendly, search &amp;amp; discovery API. In the following lesson you will learn how to sync your Firestore data to an Algolia index via Cloud Functions.</description>

      <description>In the previous lesson, we learned the fundamentals of relational data modeling with Firestore. Today I want to push further and look at several more practical examples. In addition to data modeling, we will look at techniques like duplication, aggregation, composite keys, bucketing, and more.
Keep in mind, Firestore is still in beta. Firebase engineers hinted at some really cool features on the roadmap (geo queries, query by array of ids) - I&#39;ll be sure to keep you posted :)</description>

      <description>The following article discusses patterns that I have found exceptionally useful when implementing Firebase User Authentication and Firestore in Flutter. In particular, the Provider provides an excellent solution for sharing and managing streams with minimal boilerplate. However, to take full advantage of this package you must deserialize your raw data to a Dart class.
If you are building a major project with Flutter &amp;amp; Firebase, consider enrolling in the Full Flutter Firebase Course.</description>
